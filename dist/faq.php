          Now is the winter of our discontent
            Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
            And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
            In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
            Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
            Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
            Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
            Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
            Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
            And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
            To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
            He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
            To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
            But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
            Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
            I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
            To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
            I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
